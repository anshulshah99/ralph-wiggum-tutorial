Serves the Space Invaders game homepage. The game itself is a pure
client-side TypeScript engine mounted as a React Island; the backend
only needs to render the HTML shell that contains the island mount point.

There is intentionally no database access or API surface here — the game
is entirely client-side with in-memory score tracking (see the spec's
"no server-side persistence" requirement).
