"""Tests for the Space Invaders game view.

The game is entirely client-side, so the backend's only responsibility is
to serve the HTML shell containing the React Island mount point. These tests
verify that contract: the homepage returns 200, advertises the correct
title, and includes the ``data-island="game"`` hook that ``main.ts`` uses
to mount the canvas game.
